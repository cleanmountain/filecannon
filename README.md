# Filecannon

You may know the feeling of needing to move files between phone and computer quickly and without losing data (e.g. image quality). One approach is to ZIP it and upload to a file sharing service.

This is the faster and easier alternative with a web interface, hosted entirely on your machine (speed and privacy go brr)


## How It Works
1. Launch the Flask server
2. Access the web server from another LAN device `http://<HOST-IP>:<APP-PORT>`
3. Upload and download files as you wish
4. Hit the `Clear` button when the database becomes too large

...secure from other users on the same network? **Nope!**
